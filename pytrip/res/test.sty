This package provides an easy way to perform interpolation of 1-D and 2-D datasets.

1-D dataset is represented by two columns of numbers: X and Y, of the same length.
X column should contain increasing sequence of numbers.
It is not required that X data should form regular (evenly spaced) grid.
X and Y columns of length 1 also form 1-D data (single data point).

2-D dataset is represented by two columns of numbers: X and Y.
and 2-dimensional matrix Z.
Number of columns in Z matrix should be equal to length of X array,
while number of rows to length of Y array.
Lengths of X and Y data may differ. One or both of X and Y columns may
contain single element - this is also valid 2-D dataset.
X and Y column should contain increasing sequence of numbers.
It is not required that X and Y data should form regular (evenly spaced) grid.

Two types of interpolation are supported: linear and spline (3rd degree polynomials).

Linear interpolation on 1-D dataset and on reduced 2-D datasets (where X or Y is single element column)
is performed using `interp` method from `numpy` package.

Spline interpolation on all datasets is performed using `InterpolatedUnivariateSpline` (for 1-D data)
and `RectBivariateSpline` (for 2-D data) from `scipy` package.

Cubic spline interpolation requires at least 4 data points. In case number of data points is lower,
interpolator implemented in this package will fall back to quadratic spline (for 3 data points)
or to linear interpolation (2 or less data points).
This is different behaviour from what is implemented in `scipy` package where exception is thrown is such situation.

Note: scipy package is not imported her as default as its installation is problematic for some group of users
(i.e. Windows users working without Anaconda python distribution).
Most of the functionality of this package (i.e. 1-D and some cases of 2-D linear interpolation) will work without
scipy package installed. If user without scipy package calls cubic spline interpolation method then an exception
will be thrown and an error message printed, requesting user to install scipy.
